Below is a detailed scope document for an AI agent designed to answer the query “whats my name?” using the Pydantic AI framework. This document outlines the high-level architecture, key components, external dependencies, and testing strategies, along with a curated list of relevant documentation pages that you can refer to during development.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Introduction  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  
The goal is to build an AI agent that processes user queries (in this case, “whats my name?”) by leveraging the Pydantic AI ecosystem. Although the request is trivial, the agent will be built modularly so that it can handle more complex interactions later. The scope document defines the agent’s architecture, essential components, integration points with external providers (LLMs and additional tools), and testing strategies.

Key notes:  
• The User Interface could be via Ag-UI or a CLI.  
• The Agent Controller is the central dispatcher for processing requests.  
• The Core Reasoning module handles prompt processing and interacts with external model providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face.  
• Tools & API: Here lie any built-in tools (perhaps a “user identity” tool) that the agent selects based on the nature of the question.  
• A Response Formatter module ensures the final answer is clearly presented, and all interactions are logged for traceability.

3. Core Components  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  

A. Agent Controller  
   • Responsible for receiving the “whats my name?” query.  
   • Dispatches the query to the appropriate reasoning modules.  
   • Maintains a conversation context and state persistence (if needed).  
   • Integrates with Ag-UI for visual feedback in development or production environments.

B. Core Reasoning & Language Handling Module  
   • Processes the natural language query using prompt formatting components.  
   • Integrates with external LLM providers via API wrappers (e.g., OpenAI models).  
   • May include a “function” tool that processes queries like identity extraction.

C. Tools & API Integration  
   • Implements built-in tools as defined in the Pydantic AI ecosystem for specialized tasks.  
   • For “whats my name?”, a capability could be added to check conversation history or prompt a fallback message if no identity information is recorded.  
   • Manages dynamic switching between different provider APIs (see models API documentation).

D. Response Formatter & Logger  
   • Formats the response in a consistent and user-friendly manner.  
   • Logs requests and responses using standard logging tools to meet audit and debugging requirements.

4. External Dependencies  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  

1. Pydantic AI Core Packages  
   • Core framework libraries from https://ai.pydantic.dev/  
   • API modules for agents, tools, and UI (Ag-UI)

2. External LLM APIs  
   • OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, or other provider packages – using the APIs outlined in https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/models/  
   • Providers module integration (https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/providers/)

3. Third-Party Libraries  
   • HTTP client libraries for API calls (e.g., requests, httpx)  
   • Logging libraries (e.g., loguru or built-in logging)  
   • Testing tools such as pytest to run unit/integration tests.

4. Optional: Data Persistence  
   • A simple in-memory or file-based storage tool to manage conversation state if required.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
5. Testing Strategy  
─────────────────────────────────────────────  
A robust testing strategy is key to ensuring the agent performs reliably:

A. Unit Testing  
   • Test individual components such as the query formatter, API client wrappers, and tool selection logic.  
   • Use pytest to simulate various input cases for the “whats my name?” query.  
   • Achieve high code coverage for critical business logic.

B. Integration Testing  
   • Verify that the Agent Controller interacts correctly with language modules and external API endpoints.  
   • Mock external API calls to ensure that response handling, error propagation, and fallback mechanisms are functioning properly.

C. End-to-End (E2E) Testing  
   • Simulate complete user interactions using Ag-UI or CLI interfaces.  
   • Validate that the journey from input (user query) to output (formatted response) works as expected, even when external dependencies are either mocked or provided in a staging environment.

D. Performance and Stress Testing  
   • Optionally, conduct performance tests on the reasoning module and tool integrations to assess responsiveness under load (especially when handling concurrent queries).

E. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)  
   • Automate tests using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions.
   • Integrate with test reporting tools as indicated in the Pydantic Evals documentation (https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/pydantic_evals/reporting/).
